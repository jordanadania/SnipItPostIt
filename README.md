# SnipItPostIt
This is AutoHotKey code that allows you to create a post-it note based on your clipboard.

When you use Win+Shift+S, you will activate the Windows Snip-It Tool.

Then use Alt+Ctrl+P to create the post-it note.

Move the post-it note where you want it and hit Alt+Ctrl+. (dot/period) To remove the Window's Title Bar. (You can then resize the window to remove the unnecessary white space)

You can also hit Alt+Ctrl+A to make the window AlwaysOnTop.



To build this code yourself, you will need to have AutoHotKey installed on your system.

This is the link for v1.1 which I used to write this code. Other version may or may not work.<br>
